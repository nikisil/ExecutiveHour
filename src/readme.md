This is my playground for exploring the data sets. The first notebook uses code from [this Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dimitriosroussis/electricity-price-forecasting-with-dnns-eda) on the Spanish hourly electricity prices data set. The second notebook will work on data from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov).
