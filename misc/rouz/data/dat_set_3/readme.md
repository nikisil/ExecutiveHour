# Information
Data from [nrg.org](https://www.nrg.com/resources/energy-tools/tracking-the-market.html) website. There are 3 files here, containing data for
    1. Actual Load
    2. Day-ahead market
    3. Real-time market

Actual load data are measured in MegaWatts. The day-ahead market data is data for electricity supply of the next day while real-time market is market data for the buying and selling of electricity in real-time. Thus the DA market is the less volatile of the two and is there to allow for a degree of stability in supply and demand of electricity.
